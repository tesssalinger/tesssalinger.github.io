            <p>I have developed skills in 3D design focusing on modeling, UV unwrapping, rigging, weight painting, lighting, post-processing, and animation using <strong>Blender, Maya and Cinema 4D.</strong> I’m proficient in texturing both within 3D software and traditionally in <strong>Photoshop</strong>, as well as using <strong>Substance Painter</strong> to create texture, bump, and spec maps. Additionally, I have experience with <strong>Unity</strong>, where I create 3D virtual environments to integrate my models, utilizing C# in <strong>Visual Studio</strong> for object triggers and interactions.</p>
