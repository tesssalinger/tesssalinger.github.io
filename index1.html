        <P> I have a passion for photography spanning many years,
            I've found my true joy in capturing the essence of people through my lens. There's something 
            truly magical about freezing a moment in time, immortalizing emotions, and telling stories through 
            visual narratives. My focus predominantly revolves around portrait photography, where I can delve 
            into the depths of human expression and bring my imagination to life. Through my work, I aim to 
            convey not just what I see, but also how I feel, using visuals as a language to express the intricacies 
            of emotions and experiences. Join me on this journey as I explore the art of photography and share my unique perspective with you. </P>

        <p>Within this project, I explored the theme of Dreams through portrait photography, seeking to capture the surreal and transformative essence of the subconscious. Through experimentation with various techniques and materials, I identified two potential directions for the final artwork.

            One direction involved laser cutting portraits into circular forms, providing precision and a clean aesthetic that enhanced the surrealistic style I aimed for. The circular shape symbolized fluidity and freedom, aligning with the dreamlike quality of the theme.
            
            The other direction focused on traditional portraiture, emphasizing facial expressions and body language to convey the surreal atmosphere of dreams. This approach allowed for a deeper exploration of human emotions within the dream context.
            
            For the final artwork, I chose to create a series of laser-cut portraits suspended within wooden boxes. Enlarging the circular portraits and allowing them to move freely within the boxes created an immersive, three-dimensional experience for viewers, symbolizing the transition between dream states.
            
            The artwork aimed to visually communicate the euphoric and transformative nature of dreams, with each model representing different aspects such as space, love, and peace. Symbolism, including natural motifs and color schemes, added depth and surrealism to the portraits, while meticulous planning ensured a cohesive and impactful presentation.
            
            To complement the artistic vision, I meticulously planned costumes, props, and makeup looks for the models, selecting individuals who could effectively convey the desired emotions. Using studio equipment and post-processing software, I refined the images to achieve the desired aesthetic.
            
            The final presentation involved printing the portraits on photographic paper and mounting them within wooden frames, creating a tangible and immersive viewing experience. Positioned against a neutral background, the artwork invited viewers to explore its three-dimensional aspect freely, fostering an engaging and thought-provoking encounter.</p>
