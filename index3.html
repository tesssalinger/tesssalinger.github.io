            <h2>Reminiscene</h2>
            <p>This was Tess's first time making a multiple scene virtual walkthroughgame. She used Unity to put all the elements together.
                Using Maya, she crafted intricate models, while Photoshop and Illustrator brought them to life with 
                vibrant textures. Delving into sound design added depth to the experience. With C++ coding, she seamlessly 
                integrated everything into Unity. It was a rewarding journey that taught her the journey of
                game development from start to finish.</p>
